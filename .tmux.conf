### Remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a'
unbind C-a
set-option -g prefix C-b
bind-key -r C-b send-prefix

### Status line bar configuration. There exists one for the left side, and one for the right.
# By default, status-left has "[#S] ". This will show "standard". This setting removes that.
# set -g status-left ""
# I will put the right side to nothing as well. Normally it includes hostname, time, date, see:
set -g status-right " \"#{=22:pane_title}\" %H:%M %d-%b-%y"
# but I don't need it there.
# set -g status-right ""

### This conditional can be used for if-shell in this file to only apply a bind if you are in vim
### or in some other program. Not that this doesn't for if you vi over ssh, since "ssh" will be
### the running program and not "vi".
is_vim="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
    | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?g?(view|n?vim?x?)(diff)?$'"
### less is used for git log, git diff, man, etc.
is_less="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
    | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?g?(view|n?less?x?)(diff)?$'"

is_pageupable="$is_vim || $is_less"

### start window indexing at one (default is zero)
set -g base-index 1
### start pane index at one (default is zero)
setw -g pane-base-index 1

### switching between windows should be instant
set -g repeat-time 0
### this is for when pressing escape
set -sg escape-time 0

### force tmux to use utf-8
setw -gq utf8 on
### Force utf-8
set -gq status-utf8 on

### This history is different from .zshrc for example, since these are virtual terminals. 
# number of lines in history
set -g history-limit 200000

### Switch panes: Alt+up,down,left,right. 
### Switch windows: Alt+1,2,3,4, etc. 
bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
bind -n M-Down select-pane -D

bind -n M-0 select-window -t 0
bind -n M-1 select-window -t 1
bind -n M-2 select-window -t 2
bind -n M-3 select-window -t 3
bind -n M-4 select-window -t 4
bind -n M-5 select-window -t 5
bind -n M-6 select-window -t 6
bind -n M-7 select-window -t 7
bind -n M-8 select-window -t 8
bind -n M-9 select-window -t 9

### Makes it so when you create a new pane,
# the new pane will cd to the same directory as the original pane.
# I have intentionally not done this for new windows.
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

### This makes it so the terminals used in Tmux uses the same terminals as normal. Otherwise certain things like display etc might not be available. 
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"

### Save the command prompts in tmux (e.g. prefix + : set window-size or whatever...) to a file.
set -g history-file ~/.tmux_history

### Makes it so you can use Pageup directly to enter copy-mode, without having to go through
### the prefix. If the program you are using wants to use pageup as normal, e.g. vim,
### it behaves as normal.
bind-key -n Pageup if-shell "$is_pageupable" "send-keys Pageup" "copy-mode -u"

# Bind Ctrl-{Pageup,Pagedown} to work like Pageup/Pagedown did before I started changing
# them in the above line. This means that when in e.g. vi over ssh, you can use
# Ctrl-{Pageup,Pagedown} for normal Pageup/Pagedown:ing. These will therefore use the default
# Pageup/Pagedown behaviour.
bind -n C-Pageup send-keys Pageup
bind -n C-Pagedown send-keys Pagedown

### Send the same command to all panes/windows/sessions:
# It also jumps to the beginning of the line and types
# tmuxignoring: <what was on the line before>
# This will not execute what was on that line since tmuxignoring is not a command, but show it.
# I did it like this because if something important was on that line that hadn't been executed
# yet, it will not be removed. Also note that just sending what was there first is not good
# either, since the command could be something that you were not ready to send (e.g. rm -r /).
bind e command-prompt -p "Command:" \
       "run \"tmux list-panes -a -F '##{session_name}:##{window_index}.##{pane_index}' \
                     | xargs -I PANE tmux send-keys -t PANE C-a 'tmuxignoring: ' Enter '%1' Enter\""

### Gives the ability to save the environment with prefix + s and to restore it with prefix + r
# run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-resurrect/resurrect.tmux
# I've also made it so the save is automatically done every once in a while using cron.
# This is a setting to tmux-resurrect. It makes it so that the scrollback buffers are
# also saved.
# set -g @resurrect-capture-pane-contents 'on'

### Make Home and End work when in copy mode.
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'Home' send -X start-of-line
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'End' send -X end-of-line

### Do the same for Ctrl-Arrow-{Left,Right} to jump a word in copy mode.
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi C-Left send-key -X previous-word
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi C-Right send-key -X next-word
